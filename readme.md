# LacaDM Implementation

PyTorch implementation of "Latent Causal Diffusion Model for Multiobjective Reinforcement Learning"

The whole code will be released when the paper is accepted

## Features
- Complete implementation of LacaDM architecture
- Supports both continuous and discrete environments
- Integrated Latent Causal Learning (LCL)
- Modular design for easy extension

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+

## Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Modify the MORL environment code in train.py and after that you can train LacaDM according to the follow command

```bash
python train.py
```
